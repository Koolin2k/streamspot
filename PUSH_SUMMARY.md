## 🚀 Next Steps (Manual Execution Required)

Since authentication is required for pushing to external repositories, you'll need to execute the push manually:

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)
```bash
./push-to-v0.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Git Commands
```bash
# Verify build (optional - will fail in restricted environments)
cd project && npm run build && cd ..

# Push to v0-streamspot
git push v0-streamspot copilot/fix-d80592b9-0b1c-4538-b19d-3ef7ebe29d4d
```
